        mail.split(/, | /).uniq #/ / is your regex. Inside of it is a pattern we are telling it to find so we can split.
                                # Fist pattern is just ", " from the string 
                                #Second pattern is just " ". Run binding.pry with only first pattern to understand.
                                # And = "|" which is is saying using ", " AND " " as delimeters
